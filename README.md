# MATLAB-OnrampStellarMotionProject
Analyzed data of a star's spectrum by plotting the intensity of starlight observed at each wavelength. Hydrogen is a primary component in the composition of stars, and it tends to absorb light emitted towards it, and as a result it causes a dip in the spectrum. Hydrogen absorbs light at exactly 656.3 nanometers.
